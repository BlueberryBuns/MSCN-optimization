# Main concideration
- number of location of plants in the system
- flow of raw materials from supplier to plant
- quantity of products from plants to DCs, from DCs to CZs (minimize combined facility location shipment cost)
- minimize combined facility cost, shipment cost
- Take a look @ constraints, maximum capacity, production and shipment costs

# Assumptions made in order to minimize the problem
This section targets assumptions about the supply chain at each level of product lifetime in the supply chain

# Product production (production plant)
- product needs :required_materials: of raw materials to be produced

# Transportation

# Supplier 
- each supplier has limited capabilities of producing
